Rules:

We try to connect all these albums together in one big web. 
for this task we adhere to a few restrictions:

1. Bands touring together is a valid connection, but playing a festival together is too broad, because a lot of festivals feature dozens of artists from different genres.
2. Shared Management or being signed to the same label is insufficient


how to use github:

to download the connections:
1. Make sure you have Git downloaded
2. Go to the directory you would like to store the project (eg. C:\Users\user\Desktop\ )
3. Open cmd in that folder (in Windows, simply type `cmd` in the top bar)
4. in the terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/LaurenswvMinnen/connecting-albums.git`

to upload your local changes:
1. go to the project directory
2. either in cmd or directly in the top bar, type `git add .`
		(this prepares all changes to be added, the period means all)
3. then type: `git commit -m "[[short description of your changes]]"`
4. finally, type `git push`
