Rules:

We try to connect all these albums together in one big web. 
for this task we adhere to a few restrictions:

1. Bands touring together is a valid connection, but playing a festival together is too broad, because a lot of festivals feature dozens of artists from different genres.
2. Shared Management or being signed to the same label is insufficient
